        "question": "What is NIRMAS?",
        "answer": "<strong>NIRMAS - NIA’s Investigation Reporting & Multidimensional Analysis System</strong>, is an advanced forensic tool that streamlines the investigation of social media accounts during criminal investigations. It automatically captures and processes data from platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Telegram, and more, providing investigators with accurate and court-ready evidence.<br/>NIRMAS uses two key methods to collect evidence:<ul><li><br/><strong>1. ADB Automation:</strong> When physical access to a device is available, it leverages Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to remotely control the device and capture screenshots of critical social media data, including posts, messages, contacts, and account details.</li><br/><li><strong>2. Selenium Automation:</strong> When physical access is not possible, it uses Selenium WebDriver to automate data capture via logged-in browser sessions. Additionally, if login credentials are unavailable, NIRMAS can utilize cookie data from an active browser session to bypass the login step and gain access to the necessary accounts. The tool interacts with web interfaces on social media platforms, simulating user actions such as logging in, navigating profiles, and capturing relevant data for investigation.</li></ul><br/>Once the data is collected, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is applied to convert screenshots into searchable text. This data is further processed with machine learning algorithms to perform sentiment analysis and identify suspicious content.<br/><br/>NIRMAS ensures the integrity of the collected evidence by storing cryptographic hashes of screenshots on a blockchain, creating a tamper-proof record. The collected data is also filtered based on user inputs such as keywords, dates, and contacts, ensuring only the most relevant information is presented.<br/>Finally, the tool compiles all evidence into a structured PDF report using the ReportLab Python library, ready for submission in court or further analysis.",

        "question": "Why are we using Blockchain?",
        "answer": "<ul><li><strong>1. Immutable Record:</strong> Blockchain creates an immutable (unchangeable) record of the screenshots, text, and metadata captured. Each piece of evidence is hashed and stored in a distributed ledger, ensuring that once evidence is stored, it cannot be altered without detection.</li><br/><li><strong>2. Verification:</strong> At any time, you can recompute the hash of the stored data and compare it to the original hash in the blockchain. If the hashes match, the data has not been altered, proving its authenticity. This is critical for maintaining the chain of custody and the admissibility of evidence in legal settings.</li><br/><li><strong>3. Tamper Detection:</strong> Even if someone tries to modify the evidence, blockchain would make it impossible to do so without raising an alert, as the modified data’s hash would not match the stored hash on the blockchain.</li></ul><br/><br/>What Happens Without Blockchain?<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>1.Risk of Tampering:</strong> Without blockchain, it’s easier for someone with access to the storage system (such as the database or server) to alter the data. For example, an insider with administrative privileges might modify the images, metadata, or reports without leaving any trace. This could be done by replacing images, editing text, or removing sensitive evidence.</li><br/><li><strong>2. Chain of Custody Concerns:</strong> In a legal context, maintaining the chain of custody is crucial to proving that the evidence has not been tampered with. Without blockchain, it becomes more difficult to ensure that the evidence is authentic, especially if the data is challenged in court.</li><br/><li><strong>3. Image and Data Manipulation:</strong><br/><ul><li>i. Image Modification: An image can be modified using photo-editing software, and unless there’s a secure way to check if the image has been altered, the authenticity of that image can be questioned. For example, details could be added or removed, colors could be changed, or timestamps could be altered.</li><li>ii. Metadata Editing: Metadata, such as timestamps or geolocation data, can be edited or falsified, which could mislead investigators and compromise the integrity of the investigation.</li><li>iii. Replacing Screenshots: It’s possible for someone to replace original screenshots with fabricated ones. This could happen if someone accesses the file system where the screenshots are stored, without any security mechanism (like blockchain) to verify the integrity of those images.</li></ul></li></ul>",

        "question": "How is NIRMAS going to help?",
        "answer": "NIRMAS is designed to significantly enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and thoroughness of digital investigations involving social media accounts.<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>1. Automated Data Collection:</strong> By automating the capture of social media data, it eliminates the need for manual screenshotting and documentation. This speeds up the process and reduces human error.</li><br/><li><strong>2. Comprehensive Platform Coverage:</strong> NIRMAS supports multiple social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Telegram, and others, allowing investigators to pull data from various sources and get a complete picture of a suspect's online activity.</li><br/><li><strong>3. Dual Automation Methods:</strong> Whether investigators have physical access to the suspect's device or not, NIRMAS can still collect evidence. Through ADB Automation, it captures data when the device is accessible, and through Selenium Automation, it works remotely via browser sessions.</li><br/><li><strong>4. Increased Accuracy:</strong> Using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and machine learning, it extracts text from images and performs sentiment analysis on conversations and posts, identifying suspicious content and helping investigators focus on key evidence.</li><br/><li><strong>5. Ensured Evidence Integrity:</strong> Storing cryptographic hashes of screenshots on a blockchain provides a tamper-proof, secure method to verify the authenticity of the evidence, which is crucial for maintaining chain-of-custody and legal admissibility in court.</li><br/><li><strong>6. Targeted Data:</strong> Investigators can filter the collected data by specific keywords, dates, or contacts, making it easier to sift through large amounts of information and focus on the most relevant pieces of evidence.</li><br/><li><strong>7. Streamlined Reporting:</strong> NIRMAS automatically compiles all captured data into well-organized, court-ready PDF reports, reducing the time and effort required to present findings in a professional format.</li><br/><li><strong>8. Supports Legal Investigations:</strong> By offering legally admissible evidence that is accurate and comprehensive, it supports law enforcement agencies and investigators in building stronger cases against cybercriminals, reducing the risk of evidence being contested or discarded in court.</li></ul><br/>Overall, NIRMAS speeds up investigations, ensures evidence integrity, and enhances the capacity of investigators to uncover crucial digital evidence in a variety of cases, from cyber crimes to financial fraud and beyond.",
